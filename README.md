# Express.js Asynchronous Middleware Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Express.js applications related to improper error handling within asynchronous middleware. The bug manifests as unexpected behavior or server failures when handling asynchronous operations within route handlers.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server with a route handler that simulates an asynchronous operation using `setTimeout`. While this example is simple, it highlights the importance of proper error handling in real-world scenarios where asynchronous operations might encounter errors.   Improper handling can result in silent failures, crashes, or unexpected responses.

## Bug Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle potential errors in asynchronous middleware.  It uses `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle errors and send appropriate responses to clients.
